# mks66-matrix
There is no spoon.  This will be due Monday, 2/25  Implement the following features but you cannot trivialize the problem by using a structure that already exists in the language you choose: Create a repo: mks66-line General Matrix stuff matrix multiplication  (you may assume a 4by4 times a 4byN) creation of an identity matrix displaying a matrix in a reasonable manner Graphics matrix stuff add a point to an edge matrix add an edge to an edge matrix (should call your add point routine) go through an edge matrix and draw the lines stored in the matrix (should call your draw line routine) output and display an image file Demonstrate your multiply works using the following: (do not reset the values of A and B after each operation) A = {{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8},{9,10,11,12},{13,14,15,16}} B = {{11,12,13,14},{15,16,17,18},{19,20,21,22},{23,24,25,26}} mult(A,B) print A print B mult(B,A)   print A print B mult(IDENT,A) print A Upload an image to the gallery page.
